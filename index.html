      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there! I’m Ian Clement P. Bullecer, a BS Information Systems student at 
        TUP Manila, combining my love for technology with a competitive edge in esports. 
        Balancing academics and gaming has taught me how to stay disciplined, focused, 
        and adaptable. My ambition is to leverage my skills in tech and insights from 
        gaming to contribute meaningfully to the gaming industry, whether as a developer, 
        strategist, or pro player.

      <h3 align="center">The Story Behind My Journey</h3>
      <p align="center">
        It all began with a casual gaming session with friends. Little did I
        know, that one game would spark a passion for competitive play. When the
        pandemic hit, I dedicated my time to gaming, taking it to the next level
        by competing in minor and major tournaments. Today, I am representing 
        Gearhawks Esports, an esports team in TUP Manila, in various competitive 
        MLBB tournaments.<br>
        
        <br>I've been fascinated with online gaming since
        childhood, and it's been a dream of mine to excel in this field. I hope
        that my past self would be proud of what I've achieved so far.

            <h3>33rd SCUAA NCR Games (MLBB) - Gold Medalist</h3>
            <p>This happened back in my first year at TUPM. At first, I felt a lot of pressure 
              since it was my first big tournament representing the university, and I didn’t know 
              my teammates very well. But things turned out great—we ended up winning the championship 
              and taking home the gold medal for our game title! This year, we’re joining the 
              34th SCUAA, and we’re hoping to bring home the gold again.</p>

            <h3>Collegiate Center for Esports S4 - 4th Place</h3>
            <p>Even though things didn't turn out well because we are unable to get the 3rd place,
            I am still happy with this experience. This is my first major tournament in the collegiate 
            scene and this is my first time hopping on the main stage and we placed 4th among 100+ teams. </p>

        As I continue my journey in both academics and esports, I aim to
        improve my knowledge in both academics and gaming industry. My goal 
        is to combine gaming and learning to achieve something new 
        and exciting, making a positive impact on both.
